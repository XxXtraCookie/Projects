                <p><span>1. Traveling is easier than you think.</span></p>
                <p>We believe that traveling around the world shouldn’t be hard: it’s actually something everyone should be able to do at least once in their lives. Whether you choose to spend a few years or just a couple months traveling this beautiful
                  planet, it’s important to see what’s out there. It’s up to you to make the dream come true and take the first step.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>2. Travel opens your eyes.</span></p>
                <p>If you’re open and willing, travel will make you an incredibly more well-rounded human being. And that’s really the goal, isn’t it?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>3. Traveling helps you learn who you are.</span></p>
                <p>All the challenges and opportunities travel lays at your feet help you discover who you are in a way that’s only possible on the road.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>4. Travel creates meaningful relationships</span></p>
                <p>People you meet while on the road become some of the most valued names on your contact list. They become places on the map to visit later on. These folks give you a glimpse outside your hometown circle of friends, and force you to take
                  in new and refreshing perspectives, and ultimately realize that everyone is the same.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>5. Traveling develops skills you didn’t know you had</span></p>
                <p>Sometimes it’s only far from home that you realize you you’ve got skills you’ve never used. It’s travel that brings them to the surface and makes you smile, satisfied to have reached the mountain top, or crossed a gorge or helped a villager
                  clean up after a storm, or even to have successfully ordered a meal at a rural Chinese restaurant.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>6. Travel helps you learn new languages</span></p>
                <p>There’s something satisfying about being able to throw around a few words of Greek, knowing how to say thanks in Thai, pulling out that long dormant Spanish to book a room in Santiago, or simply hearing a language you didn’t know existed
                  just a few weeks before.

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>7. Travel means adventure</span></p>
                <p>Zip-lining over the jungle canopy in Peru, successfully navigating the maze-like streets of Venice, bartering for the best price in the traditional markets of Marrakech, taking a speedboat ride in New Zealand, or hopping in a Land Rover
                  and heading out to watch animals grazing in Tanzania: these are adventures worth having. People are hardwired for the excitement of adventure and travel may just be the best way to tap into it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>8. Traveling gives you perspective</span></p>
                <p>Meeting people from other cultures will teach you that the way you’ve been looking at the world isn’t the way everybody else does. In fact, your point-of-view might have some major blind spots. Seeing the world for yourself will improve
                  your vision and your grip on reality.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>9. Travel helps you move forward</span></p>
                <p>If you’re between jobs, schools, kids, or relationships, around the world travel can be a perfect way to move from one of these life stages into your next great adventure. A big trip won’t just ease your transition into the next stage
                  of your life, it’ll give you a chance to reflect on where you’ve been, where you’re going, and where you want to end up.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>10. Travel is education</span></p>
                <p>Seeing the world provides an education that’s absolutely impossible get in school. Travel teaches you economy, politics, history, geography, and sociology in an intense, hands-on way no class will. Fortunately, the school of travel is
                  always taking applications, no entrance exam required.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>11. Travel challenges you</span></p>
                <p>Getting your daily latte at the same place and staring at your screen at your nine-to-five every day not nearly interesting enough? Even if you choose to work on the road (and keep staring at the screen), you’ll have to find a new place
                  to drink your latte, and depending on your destination, finding coffee, and foamy milk or a good place to sip them could prove to be a sizeable challenge. Travel is full of moments of joy and challenges. Overcoming the challenges gives
                  you some of the greatest joys of all.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>12. Travel shakes things up</span></p>
                <p>It sucks to be stuck in a rut. Everyone knows what that’s like. A big trip can be your perfect solution. Fly around the world, stopping over in all of the places you’ve always wanted to visit. Go ahead and plan your ideal route around
                  the world (it’s easier than you think!)</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>13. Traveling proves that dreams do come true</span></p>
                <p>You imagined it, daydreamed about it, envisioned it. Guess what? It can be done. Around the world travel is possible, you just have to decide you’re willing to take the first step and start planning your itinerary. What are you waiting
                  for? We’ve put together some specials to inspire you to live your dream.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>14. Travel gives you cool stories</span></p>
                <p>Let’s face it. Even for folks who can’t tell a story, just the words “last year in Mongolia” get you instant party points. Even when events seem trivial, nostalgia and distance create an irresistible spin that makes mundane things like
                  getting your laundry done in Zanzibar, entertaining. Just don’t be that person and overdo it!</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>15. Travel is literally food for thought.</span></p>
                <p>You’ll be constantly surprised at the flavors the world has to offer. The way people in other cultures and countries prepare food, and break bread together (not that all cultures even eat bread) will astound you.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>16. Travel gives you a sense of accomplishment</span></p>
                <p>If you’re the kind of person that dreams big, you’re probably one to reach for new challenges. Finishing a trip gives you the satisfaction that you were able make a goal to travel and accomplish what you set out to do–see the world.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p><span>17. Traveling for the hell of it</span></p>
                <p>Why travel? Because you can. Because you want to. Because it beats the alternative (staying home). Why not pick up your tickets and get the ball rolling!</p>
